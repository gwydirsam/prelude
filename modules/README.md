## Abstract

**Prelude** offers only enhancements to the core Emacs experience. The
  Prelude modules on the other hand offer some additional niceties
  such as enhanced support for various programming languages.


## Modules

Here's a list of the existing Prelude modules.

### C

Prelude's C module adds some basic customizations to cc-mode and
makefile-mode. It depends on the **prelude-programming** module.

### Clojure

Basic Clojure programming support, built on top of Prelude's generic
Lisp programming enhancements.

### Programming

Adds some settings common for all programming modes (those that derive
prog-mode) like comments
spell checking, whitespace-mode, etc.

### Ruby

Adds a few goodies to the built-in ruby-mode.

### Python

Replaces the built-in python-mode with the newer python.el.

### Scheme

Basic Scheme programming support, built on top of Prelude's generic
Lisp programming enhancements.

### Emacs Lisp

### Common Lisp

Mostly SLIME tweaks.

### Haskell

Basic haskell-mode configuration.

### Erlang

### CSS

Adds rainbow-colors to css-mode.

### SCSS

### Org
